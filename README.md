In the dynamic realm of artificial intelligence and machine learning, thereâ€™s a unique fascination with unraveling the intricacies of handwritten digit reconstruction. From deciphering the strokes to generating authentic representations, recent years have witnessed groundbreaking strides in this field. In this Project, we embark on an exploration of three transformative techniques that have redefined the landscape of handwritten digit reconstruction: Stacked Autoencoders, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Deep Convolutional GANs.
